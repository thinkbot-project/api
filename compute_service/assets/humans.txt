thinkbot is the brainchild of Harish Narayanan <mail@harishnarayanan.org>

The service stands on the shoulders of a number of Free Software
projects, including Linux, Nginx, Django, Python, R, GNU Octave,
RabbitMQ, Celery, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap. It is lovingly-crafted in
GNU Emacs.

Do get in touch if you'd like to contribute to it!
