    <h2 id="features-status">Development Status and Sponsorships</h2>
    <p>After some enlightening conversations with my <a href="#partners">supportive partners</a>, I&#8217;ve been hard at work on a set of features that I think will benefit computational scientists and educators everywhere. If you find a feature particularly interesting for your problem domain, please do let me know. I would love to hear your thoughts on what you find useful so that I can prioritise what to focus on next.</p>
    <p>Also, if you&#8217;d like to speed up the development on any of these fronts, please consider sponsoring my time to work on them. I am looking to raise about $5000 each month to focus on thinkbot full-time, and hope to complete most of the following features in about 6 months of full-time effort.</p>
    <p>In addition to having me prioritise your feature of choice, if you sponsor $1000 or more, you will receive a whole year of premium access to thinkbot. If you sponsor $2500 or more, you will also receive access to the full source code for the project.</p>
