<h2>Getting started with thinkbot</h2>
<p>thinkbot&#8217;s API is organised as a <a href="#resources">set of resources</a> that can be manipulated with well-defined requests to the service. All requests to thinkbot are required to be over SSL and begin with:</p>
<pre><code>https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/
</code></pre>
<p>You generally need to authenticate with thinkbot when interacting with it. As you&#8217;ll soon see, this is easily done with your personal authentication token, <code>{{ user_token }}</code>, that you can find in <a href="/dashboard/">your dashboard</a>. This token is supposed to be unique to you, so please keep it a secret.</p>
<p>Grabbed your key? Then you&#8217;re ready for your very first interaction with thinkbot. We&#8217;re going to ask it to add two numbers using a one-line Python script that we&#8217;re going to submit using curl. Open a terminal window and type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/ \
     -H "Authorization:  Token {{ user_token }}" \
     -F "name=My first thinkbot calculation" \
     -F "environment=python27" \
     -F "code=print 1 + 2"
</code></pre>
<p>{% if not user.is_authenticated %}
(You can copy and paste the code above into your terminal, but remember to change the authentication token to yours!)
{% endif %}</p>
<p>Once submitted, thinkbot puts your script into a queue and immediately responds with some handy information about your request:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "url": "https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/",
    "status": "submitted",
    "owner": "awesome_researcher",
    "created": "2013-08-22T11:36:58.907Z",
    "name": "My first thinkbot calculation",
    "environment": "python27",
    "code": "print 1 + 2",
    .
    .
    .
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this information comes to you serialised as JSON, and that&#8217;s one of the primary ways you&#8217;ll be exchanging data with thinkbot. The critical pieces of information here are the <code>status</code> field, which lets you know your code has been submitted to thinkbot and the <code>url</code> field, <code>https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/</code>, which lets you know where the script you&#8217;ve just submitted resides. We can use this URL to later check up on the status of our script, as well as retrieve interesting results when it completes.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use this URL to check up on our simple Python one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>curl -X GET https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/ \
     -H "Authorization:  Token {{ user_token }}"
</code></pre>
<p>thinkbot happily responds with a bunch of information,</p>
<pre><code>{
    "url": "https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/",
    "status": "completed",
    .
    .
    "code": "print 1 + 2",
    .
    .
    "stdout": "3\n",
    .
    .
}
</code></pre>
<p>including the fact that your script <code>completed</code> successfully and that it printed the number <code>3</code> to standard output. So there you have it, we submitted a simple calculation to thinkbot and it got back to us with the right answer.</p>
<p>This first example gave  a quick taste for how it is to interact with thinkbot, but I admit it was remarkably unexciting. But hang in there, things start getting much more exciting once you realise:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You can submit all kinds of sophisticated code to thinkbot</strong> involving various languages and scientific computing libraries, not just Python one-liners</li>
<li><strong>thinkbot can return numerical results in a variety of formats</strong>, not just serialised JSON</li>
<li><strong>Any mechanism that can handle standard HTTP request/response can interact with thinkbot</strong>, not just curl on the command-line. This includes <a href="https://plus.google.com/100382636415340600164/posts/j6SwiVP2UJB">clients on iOS devices</a> and Ajax, as you&#8217;ll soon see.</li>
</ol>
<h2>More realistic usage</h2>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve whet your appetite, let&#8217;s move onto a more substantial example. This time, we&#8217;re going to solve a three-dimensional nonlinear elasticity problem using the finite element method. Once more, our code is going to be in Python, but now we&#8217;re going to submit a larger input program (<a href="https://thinkbot.net/assets/files/docs/examples/hyperelasticity.py">hyperelasticity.py</a>) and we&#8217;re going to request our solution in the <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK format</a>. The execution of this Python code relies on the <a href="http://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS Project</a>, which is one of the <a href="#environments">handy software environments</a> that thinkbot offers.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started. <a href="https://thinkbot.net/assets/files/docs/examples/hyperelasticity.py">Download the Python script</a> we want to run to a convenient location and navigate to it in your terminal. To begin with, let&#8217;s again use curl to submit this code to thinkbot.</p>
<pre><code>curl -X POST https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/ \
    -H "Authorization:  Token {{ user_token }}" \
    -F "name=Twisting a hyperelastic block using thinkbot" \
    -F "environment=fenics11" \
    -F "code=&lt;hyperelasticity.py" \
    -F "variables=u.vtk"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice a few things. We&#8217;ve now defined that the environment this code relies on is <code>fenics11</code> (FEniCS Project 1.1), that we intend to submit code from our <code>hyperelasticity.py</code> file, and that we&#8217;d like to have the output variable <code>u</code> (defined in our Python code) in VTK format.</p>
<p>Again, thinkbot immediately returns with a bunch of JSON-encoded information about the code we just <code>submitted</code>. But this time you know what to look for. Grab the <code>url</code> attribute from the response and check on the status of our submission.</p>
<pre><code>curl -X GET https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/ \
     -H "Authorization:  Token {{ user_token }}"
</code></pre>
<p>If everything went well, you&#8217;ll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "url": "https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/",
    "status": "completed",
    .
    .
    "results": ["https://thinkbot.net/results/job_id/u.vtk"],
    .
    .
}
</code></pre>
<p>Voil&agrave;! thinkbot has successfully <code>completed</code> running our code and the result we asked for is waiting for us in the <code>results</code> URL. (If the status indicates that your code is still <code>running</code>, wait for a few seconds and retry the <code>GET</code> request.) You can now head on over to this URL and download the result of the computation.</p>
<pre><code>curl -X GET -O https://thinkbot.net/results/job_id/u.vtk \
     -H "Authorization:  Token {{ user_token }}"
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to admire these beautiful results locally, you need a visualisation program like <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">Paraview</a>. If you setup such a program and open <code>u.vtk</code>, you&#8217;ll be greeted with the following, which you can play with and analyse.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "img/docs/examples/hyperelasticity.png" %}" alt="Sample thinkbot output visualised in external software"></p>
<h2>More exciting usage</h2>
<p>Using curl to communicate with thinkbot and Paraview to visualise the results is a reasonable way of solving the scientific problem at hand, but it isn&#8217;t as cool (or convenient) as <a href="http://mechanicsacademy.com/demo/thinkbot-api/">solving the entire problem from within the web-browser</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://mechanicsacademy.com/demo/thinkbot-api/"><img class="img-responsive" src="{% static "img/docs/examples/ma-thinkbot-demo.png" %}" alt="thinkbot demo on Mechanics Academy"></a></p>
<p>This means that your scientific calculations can be shown to (or even edited, if you&#8217;d like by) anyone with a URL to your calculation. Imagine the possibilities for teaching and reproducible science! It&#8217;s this thought that motivated the design of thinkbot.</p>
<p>In order to interact with thinkbot in this manner, you need to be comfortable with in-browser JavaScript programming. You&#8217;ll still be hitting the same API endpoints as we did with curl, but now you&#8217;re going do be doing this via Ajax instead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll sketch out the tasks below, and leave the actual implementation for you as an exercise. Remember, if you get stuck, you can always lookup <a href="http://mechanicsacademy.com/assets/js/thinkbot-ajax.js">how the demonstration above was implemented</a>.</p>
<p>First you need to define handy JavaScript helpers like the following which allow you to retrieve results from thinkbot.</p>
<pre><code>jQuery.extend({
     get_thinkbot: function(url) {
         var response = null;
         $.ajax({
             url: url,
             type: 'get',
             dataType: 'json',
             async: false,
             success: function(data) {
                 response = data;
             }
         });
         return response;
     }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Once defined, you can use such a function to retrieve information about submitted code from thinkbot.</p>
<pre><code>response = $.get_thinkbot("https://thinkbot.net/api/v1/jobs/job_id/");
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can get solution fields from within this response object via</p>
<pre><code>results = response.results;
</code></pre>
<p>and proceed to render them within the browser. In the example above, I&#8217;ve rendered VTK output from thinkbot using the <a href="http://goxtk.com/">XTK library</a>, but you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;ve made it this far, congratulations! You now have a good overview of what thinkbot can do for you. For specific details, do look at the complete list of API <a href="#resources">resources</a> and endpoints below. Remember thinkbot&#8217;s API and this documentation are a work in progress.
